    Unconditional on purpose. The daily automation passes a min_drift threshold
    because at ~3 s/day the RTC rarely needs writing and every write is a chance
    to corrupt it. A person pressing this has already decided the clock needs
    setting, and a press that answers "close enough" would be answering a
    question nobody asked.

    Failures propagate: async_sync_clock raises when it cannot verify the
    read-back or cannot re-enable Time Sync, and that reaches the UI as a failed
    action. Swallowing it would leave a wrong clock looking like a good press —
    the exact silent-failure shape this feature exists to remove.
