"""P2 — Register map, telemetry decoders, and control encoders.

Maps the Deye logger's Modbus holding registers to the Home Assistant entity
keys used by ha-deyecloud-bridge, so the BLE integration is a drop-in.

Every register address + scaling below was confirmed by a live same-second
comparison of a BLE read against the corresponding Deye Cloud / HA sensor value
(see local-deye-cloud/docs/stats-register-decode.md and the capture in
local-deye-cloud/captures/app_readmap.txt). The decode tests assert against the
exact captured `+ok=` frames, so they catch any regression against real device
data rather than against re-derived assumptions.

`daily_consumption` has no dedicated register — the cloud computes it — so it is
NOT decoded here; it is derived in the entity layer (P4) from a midnight
baseline of `total_consumption` (0x020F), mirroring the cloud bridge's
daily_grid_import sensor.
