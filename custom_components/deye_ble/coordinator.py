        The RTC ignores plain register writes: it commits whatever is staged in
        0x003E-0x0040 when the Time Sync bit (0x00E4 bit 0) goes on -> off. So a
        sync is a sequence, not a write:

            read 0x00E4 -> set bit0 -> settle -> stage clock -> clear bit0

        Four things this must get right, each paid for in evidence
        (local-deye-cloud/docs/inverter-clock-2026-08-09.md and the observation
        log for 2026-08-13):

        * The sequence ALWAYS ends with Time Sync ON — it does not restore the
          flag to whatever it was. Two reasons. Time Sync off means the logger's
          cloud calibration cannot reach the RTC, which is how the phone app's
          "set time" silently broke the clock in the first place; finding it off
          is a fault to repair, not a preference to preserve. And a final write
          of a CLEARED bit would itself be a falling edge — a second commit —
          which, if an error had interrupted the three clock writes, would latch
          a mixture of newly written words and stale ones: a new date against an
          old time, wrong by hours or days. Ending on a rising edge cannot
          commit anything, so that failure mode does not exist rather than being
          handled.
        * The whole sequence runs under ONE lock, so no poll can land inside an
          open commit window. A link that ERRORS is dropped before the next
          attempt — the exception is caught outside the session context, so
          keepalive's drop-on-error runs. A verification mismatch is different
          and deliberately keeps the link: the link demonstrably works (we just
          read back through it), the fault is in the write, and reconnect churn
          on this logger has its own history of wedging the radio.
        * The write is not reliable first time (a year byte 0x1A once landed as
          0x7A). The readback is verified by drift against a fresh now, and the
          target is re-derived on every attempt — never a replayed intent.
        * A failed re-enable fails the whole call. Cloud calibration really is
          left disabled in that case, and reporting success would reproduce the
          silent failure this feature exists to fix.

        Deliberately does not go through :meth:`_write_regs`: that path's strict
        read-back equality is right for every other control and wrong for a
        register that ticks while you look at it. The clock is also never added
        to ``_tracked_values`` — it legitimately changes every second, so
        reassert would fight the inverter forever.

        Raises HomeAssistantError if no attempt verifies, or if the clock landed
        but Time Sync could not be re-enabled.
