"""Bleak I/O layer for the Deye logger BLE local protocol.

This is the only module that touches hardware. It owns the GATT connection,
enables notifications, sends AT commands, and awaits the matching notification.
All byte construction / parsing is delegated to the pure `protocol` module so
the wire logic can be tested without a radio.

One BLE central at a time: the phone app and HA cannot both connect.
