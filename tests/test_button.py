"""The Sync Clock button.

Drives the real button entity against the real coordinator and the FakeInverter
from test_clock_coordinator — no mocks, and no re-implementation of the sync
sequence, which is already covered there. What is tested here is only what the
button itself adds: that pressing it runs an unconditional sync, that a failure
reaches the caller, and that the drift entity is not left stale afterwards.
