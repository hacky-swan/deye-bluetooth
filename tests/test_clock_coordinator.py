    Models the one behaviour the design turns on: the staged clock registers are
    committed ONLY on the Time Sync bit0 on->off edge. Telemetry reads fall
    through to the captured frames so a real poll can run against it.

    MODELLING RULE, LEARNED THE HARD WAY. Model only what the hardware evidence
    establishes, and where its behaviour is unknown make the fake PERMISSIVE —
    an unknown must let a bug through and fail the test, never quietly absorb
    it. The first version of this fake cleared staging on every sync-on write
    and refused to latch unless all three words were present in that window.
    Both were invented; neither appears in
    local-deye-cloud/docs/inverter-clock-2026-08-09.md. Together they made a
    real corruption bug inexpressible — a partial stage followed by a falling
    edge — and every test passed with that bug present. A missing test looks
    missing; a lying fake looks like coverage.

    So: a write lands in the staging register and STAYS there, and a falling
    edge commits whatever each of the three registers currently holds — the
    newly written word where one was written, the RTC's own value where none
    was. A mixture of new date and stale time is therefore reachable here,
    because it is reachable on the device.

    *require_settle* additionally ignores words staged less than MODELLED_SETTLE
    after the sync-on write. That is the rehearsal hypothesis (one failure
    without a gap, one success with one, 2026-08-13) encoded as hardware
    behaviour — it is NOT confirmed, and this fake must never be cited as
    evidence that the hardware needs the gap. It is kept because it makes the
    fake stricter than reality might be, which is the safe direction, and it
    stops the delay being deleted as dead weight.

    *corrupt_attempts* reproduces the observed bad write: the year byte 0x1A
    landing as 0x7A (year 2122) in the numbered commit window(s).

    *fail_write_reg* raises on every write to that register — used to interrupt
    the sequence mid-stage. *fail_enable_after_commit* raises on a flag write
    that would set bit 0 once a commit has already happened, i.e. it fails the
    final re-enable only.
