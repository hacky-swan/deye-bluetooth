"""Transport resilience tests — the disconnect must never wedge the BLE lock.

A hung ``BleakClient.disconnect()`` on a flaky ESP32-proxy link used to hold the
coordinator's ``_ble_lock`` forever (the ``async with transport`` teardown never
returned), leaving every entity ``unavailable`` until HA restarted. These tests
pin the bounded-teardown contract that prevents that wedge.

Fakes ``establish_connection`` so no radio/bleak backend is needed.
